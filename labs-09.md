**Purpose: Show JavaScript and regular expression generation, auto-generate routine mappings**

1. Create a new file as **phone.js**

```
code phone.js
```

2. Prompt Copilot to create a function with a regular expression to validate a US phone number. You can use the **CMD+I** interface and just *Accept* the results.
```
create a function to validate any global phone number using a regular expression
```
![Regex function to validate phone #](./images/cdd127.png?raw=true "regex function to validate phone #")

3. Let's tell it to document the function by highlighting the code, invoking **CMD+I** and **/doc**.  You can just Accept the results.

![Automatic doc of function](./images/cdd128.png?raw=true "Automatic doc of function")  

4. Now let's see how Copilot can generate some data and mappings for us automatically. Enter the prompt below in the main/separate chat text entry area.
```
create a mapping of all 50 states to area codes where
the key is the state abbreviation and the value
 is an array of area codes with max 10
```
5. After running this, Copilot will generate the start of a list as shown below. Hover over the output area and click to insert the updates at the cursor in the *phone.js* file. (This assumes the cursor is below the previous function in the file.)

![Automatic gen of data](./images/cdd129.png?raw=true "Automatic gen of data") 

6. You can scroll to the bottom to confirm if you got entries for all the states. If you didn't, you could create additional prompts for specific ranges of states, change the number of values downward, etc. You could then copy these into your file if you want. In the past GitHub Copilot Chat may have also added the disclaimer at the bottom of the output that these may not be actual values.
   
![Disclaimer on actual values](./images/cdd132.png?raw=true "Disclaimer on actual values") 

7. Let's verify whether or not we have the actual area codes. We can ask Copilot whether or not there the area codes are the actual values. Enter the following in the chat interface.

```
Are those the actual area codes or, is that fabricated data?
```
![Verify Area Code data](./images/pic023.png?raw=true "Verify Area Code data") 

This is another exmaple of GitHub Copilot providing additional resoruces to help you verify the latest information. In this case, it's suggesting you go to the North American Numbering Plan Administration (NANPA) where you can find the most up-to-date information on area codes.  You can go to that source and see if the area codes generated by Copilot are accurate. Copilot has evolved to compensate for the fact that the LLM may not have the most up-to-date information.
